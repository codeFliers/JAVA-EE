# JAVA-EE 
(² mean in the glossary)

It complet JAVA SE² Framework and give the possibility to handle distributed application².

It is divised in 3 layers: **client** (*1*), a **medium** (*2*) and **data** (*3*).

   -(*1*) interact with the user (JSE², Applet² and web pages)
   
   -(*2*) handle HTTP Request of the client (Servlet²)
   
   -(*3*) DB or others
   
Every part of it are running in "**containers**"² who are virtualised environment in which application get executed (app container), applet (applet container) and
the handle of http request by the server (web container).

Put in a very simple way, it is very usefull in Enterprise ecosystems and to get into web application development.

### How is the basic logic structure of a Web Application ?

      Client => HTTP REQUEST => Web Container (Servlet, JSP² and .java classes) => DB
      
A request is interpreted by the "**Controller**", namely the "*Servlet*".

According to the request, it ask to the java classes "**model**" the execution of a task / work.

These classes may need to communicate with the database if needed.

Then, after having retrieved the task result, the Servlet ask the "*JSP*" which is the "**View**", to generate dynamically the HTML pages.

In the end, the client obtain a response, an updated view.


We have a *MVC architecture* : **M** (Classes) **V** (JSP) **C** (Servlet).


### How does a JAVA EE Project look like ?

![project archi](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58827656/130973322-ed157119-b95b-4dcf-9d7b-59b3932e3c16.png)


*web.xml*: A file descriptor that is partialy depreciated since the v3.0 of the Servlet.  It handle the life cycle of the application, the servlet,  session and many more...
Now we use what is called "annotation".  

For example, it can have default value that we can use in our code:  

```

<context-param>
    <param-name>myValueName</param-name>
    <param-value>My Value Result</param-value>
</context-param>

```

Access it :  
```
//"My Value Result" as a result
out.println("<h1>" + servletContext.getInitParameter("myValueName")  + "</h1>");

```  


An annotation is directly put into the servlet file and can have multiple paramters. The most basic one is his name:

```
@WebServlet(name = "helloServlet", value = "/hello-servlet");
)

```


*pom.xml*: It is an XML file that contains information about the project and configuration details used by Maven to build the project. It handle every dependencies you need and can be reuse on multiple projects.

A Servlet inherite from the class "httpServlet" which inherite from GenericServlet and implement the interface from Servlet.
It ehence the server functionnality by handling request and response, most often HTTP.  
A Servlet rewrite differents methods: init(), service() and doXXX (get, post ...):

  First, the container execute *init()* that initialise variables, it look like a constructor.  
  Then, it is the *service* method that take 2 parameters : *(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)*.  
  The *do**XXX*** depending (ie: doGet if GET).  
  Finaly, the *destroy()* method.





### Simple example of an MVC architecture with delegation principal

Basic HTML Form in GET:  

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
      <meta charset="UTF-8">
      <title>Title</title>
  </head>
  <body>
      <form method="get" action="handleProcessServlet">
          Ground code:<input type="text" name="groundCode" />
          <br/>
          Sport autorisé(s):
          <select name="selectSport" multiple="multiple">
              <option value="1">Badminton</option>
              <option value="2">Foot</option>
              <option value="3">Tenis</option>
          </select>
          <br/>
          <input type="submit" value="Valider"/>
      </form>
  </body>
</html>

```

First Servlet that handle the task / result from the class :

```

@WebServlet(name = "handleProcessServlet", value = "/handleProcessServlet")
public class HandleProcessServlet extends HttpServlet {
    private int idGround;
    private Map<String, String[]> listSportAllowed;

    public void init() {
        this.listSportAllowed = new HashMap<>();
    }

    @Override
    protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
        System.out.println("method doGet()");

        this.listSportAllowed = request.getParameterMap();
        this.idGround = Integer.parseInt(request.getParameter("idGround"));

        //Delegation (Ground handle the object creation)
        Ground newGround = new Ground(idGround, "Concrete");
        //Update the request
        request.setAttribute("newGround", newGround);
        request.setAttribute("listSportAllowed", listSportAllowed);

        //Dispatch: to draw the result, we use handleResultServlet
        RequestDispatcher rd = request.getRequestDispatcher("/HandleResultServlet");
        rd.forward(request, response);
    }
    
```
We use *RequestDispatcher* and *forward* to update the Request with new data (newGround and ListSportAllowed).  
Then, we let handleResultServlet handle the rest (**Delegation**). What is it ? We just let an other Servlet handle the job itself.


The one that handle the result :

```

@WebServlet(name = "HandleResultServlet", value = "/HandleResultServlet")
public class HandleResultServlet extends HttpServlet {
    @Override
    protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
        PrintWriter out = response.getWriter();
        out.println("<!DOCTYPE html>");
        out.println("<html>");
        out.println("<head>");
        out.println("<meta charset=\"UTF-8\">");
        out.println("<title>Ground info</title>");
        out.println("</head>");
        out.println("<body>");
        out.println("<p>");
        out.println("<strong>Ground ID: </strong>"+((Ground)request.getAttribute("newGround")).getIdGround()+"<br/>");

        String res = "";
        Map<String, String[]> listSportAllowed = (Map<String, String[]>)request.getAttribute("listSportAllowed");
        for (Map.Entry<String, String[]> entry : listSportAllowed.entrySet()) {
            String key = entry.getKey();
            String[] value = entry.getValue();
            if(key.equals("selectSport")) {
                for(String str : value) {
                    res += str + " ";
                }
            }
        }
        out.println("<strong>Sport allowed: </strong>"+res);
        out.println("</p>");
        out.println("</body>");
        out.println("</html>");
        out.flush();
        out.close();
    }
  
```
Then there is the Ground class ...

**What is include() ?**  
*include()* is an usefull method from RequestDispatcher that give the possibility to include code from an other file.  
For example, in web development HTML code are use by many pages and to not write it down each time, you can reuse it: 
```
<footer>
    i am a footer
</footer>
``` 
``` 
out.println("<strong>Sport autorisé(s): </strong>"+res);
out.println("</p>");

RequestDispatcher rd = request.getRequestDispatcher("/footer.html");
rd.include(request, response);

out.println("</body>");
out.println("</html>");
out.flush();
out.close();
```
```
<html>
   <head>
      <meta charset="UTF-8">
      <title>Confirmation réception terrain info</title>
   </head>
   <body>
      <p>
         <strong>Code terrain: </strong>10<br>
         <strong>Sport autorisé(s): </strong>1 
      </p>
      <footer>
         i am a footer
      </footer>
   </body>
</html>
```
 **Redirection**  
We can use **redirection** if we want to do a new URL Request. We can then redirect to a servlet or a webpage :
```
  <form action="RedirectionServlet" method="Get">
    <input type="submit" name="RedirectionServlet" value="RedirectionServlet">
  </form>

  <form action="RedirectionServlet" method="Get">
    <input type="submit" name="RedirectionWebsite" value="RedirectionWebsite">
  </form>
```
```
  @WebServlet(name = "RedirectionServlet", value = "/RedirectionServlet")
public class RedirectionServlet extends HttpServlet {
    @Override
    protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
        if (request.getParameter("RedirectionWebsite") != null) {
            response.sendRedirect("https://www.google.fr");

        } else if (request.getParameter("RedirectionServlet") != null) {
            response.setStatus(HttpServletResponse.SC_MOVED_TEMPORARILY);
            response.setHeader("Location", request.getContextPath() + "/test.html");
        }
        //...
    }
```
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
   <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Title</title>
   </head>
   <body>
      <p>HELLO redirection test</p>
   </body>
</html>
 ```
 
 **How to handle error**  
It is possible to use the method "*sendError()*" from HttpServletResponse:
 ```
protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) {
   response.sendError(HttpServletResponse.SC_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR); //500
}
 ```
 
 To add personalization (web.xml and a custom HTML page "pageError500.html" that work like a redirection):  
 ```
 <error-page>
   <error-code>500</error-code>
   <location>/pageError500.html</location>
 </error-pages>
 ```
 
 We could add this code to a previous example:
 
 ```
 //...
}else {
      //SC_NOT_FOUND : Resource not found
      response.sendError(HttpServletResponse.SC_NOT_FOUND, "The parameter is null and so the resource asked");
}
 ```
 
**Asynchronous servlet**

Asynchronous mean that multiple part of a program can work on their own in parallel. This functionality is handled by "Threads" but
a program does have a limited pool of it and here come two issues :  
First, like i said they are limited in numbers. And secondly, the power available to handle them is limited too : resources exhaustion.  
In a Web project, where we can face many users at the same time, it is an issue.  

To solve the pool issue, we can use *asynchronous servlet*. We will need one of the main threads and as it take notice of the HTTP Request, it will then charge a "child" thread
to this specific task. While the child is working (child labor is ok), the parent return to the initial pool to be available again.

A simple example: 

```
@WebServlet(urlPatterns = "/asyncServlet", asyncSupported = true)
public class TestAsyncServlet extends HttpServlet {
    @Override
    protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request,
                         HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
        final long startTime = System.nanoTime();
        //the request is now asynchronous
        final AsyncContext asyncContext = request.startAsync(request, response);

        System.out.println(1);
        //background / child thread
        new Thread() {

            @Override
            public void run() {
                try {
                    System.out.println(3);
                    //The required facilities in order for the application
                    //to further interact with the current request and response are accessible
                    ServletResponse response = asyncContext.getResponse();
                    response.setContentType("text/plain");
                    PrintWriter out = response.getWriter();
                    Thread.sleep(2000);
                    out.print("Work completed. Time elapsed: " + (System.nanoTime() - startTime));
                    out.flush();
                    //complete the asynchronous request processing
                    asyncContext.complete();
                    System.out.println(4);
                } catch (IOException | InterruptedException e) {
                    throw new RuntimeException(e);
                }
            }
        }.start();
        //the response should not be committed - and also not sent to the client - when doGet() method execution completes.
        System.out.println(2);
        //the original HTTP thread will return to the HTTP thread pool and will become ready to handle another incoming request.
    }
}
```
First, we need the servlet to be asynchronous : *asyncSupported = true*.  
Then, we have to give to our http request an asynchronous context : *final AsyncContext asyncContext = request.startAsync(request, response)*.  
What is going to happen is that the thread which started the HTTP request will create an asyncContext object, start a child thread and - end - the doGet method.
It is important to understand that the task is not his : after sysout (1), we don't go to the (3) but at the end of the method (2).  
At this moment, the main thread completed his job and may return to the HTTP thread pool. While in the other end, the child thread will use the asyncContext object, take all the time it need and enventualy finish his duty before being released : *asyncContext.complete()*.

To know when the child thread is one, we can add a listener to the asyncContext : 

```
        asyncContext.addListener(new AsyncListener() {
            @Override
            public void onTimeout(AsyncEvent event) throws IOException {
                System.out.println("on time out");
            }
            @Override
            public void onStartAsync(AsyncEvent event) throws IOException {
                System.out.println("onStartAsync()");
            }
            @Override
            public void onError(AsyncEvent event) throws IOException {
                System.out.println("onerror");
            }
            @Override
            public void onComplete(AsyncEvent event) throws IOException {
                System.out.println("onComplete");
            }
        }, request, response);
    }
```
We will then have : 
```
1
2
3
4
onComplete
```
